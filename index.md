## Programmer
The main reason I wanted to become a programmer is because I love to **[
     problem-solve]**. This career path felt like it would allow to me solve all different types of problems and it really excited me.

## Favorite Quote
Napoleon Hill once said:
>Think twice before you speak, because your words and influence will plant the seed of either success or failure in the mind of another.

I chose this quote because I always think about the impact my interactions with others can have on them, so I always try to be positive to others.
